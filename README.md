# Microelectronic Circuits (7th Edition)

This repository contains my personal study notes and problem-solving logs while reviewing the **7th edition** of *"Microelectronic Circuits"* by Sedra and Smith.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to reinforce my understanding of analog circuit design and transistor-level analysis by solving end-of-chapter problems. I use this as a review log to track which problems were challenging during each pass through the book.

## Structure

- Each folder (`Ch1`, `Ch2`, ..., `Ch10`) corresponds to a chapter in the textbook.
- Inside each chapter folder:
  - `attempt1.txt`: Problems I found difficult during the **first pass**.  
    (Note: Design and PSpice problems were skipped in the first round.)
  - `attempt2.txt`: Problems I found difficult during the **second pass**.  
    (Includes **all** problem types, including Design and PSpice.)


## Summary Notes

In addition to problem tracking, I maintain a concise concept summary in:

'Docs/Circuit_Analysis_Summary.md'

This file includes key formulas, techniques, and problem-solving strategies I personally found important while working through the chapters.

## Disclaimer

These notes are intended for **personal review and self-improvement**. This is not a complete solution set and may contain errors. Feedback is welcome, but this is primarily a private log made public.
